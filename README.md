# DataCompression
Code by:-Om Patil

This program processes an image by modifying its pixel intensity values based on predefined ranges, effectively reducing the number of intensity levels. It iterates through each pixel, assigns new values based on specified thresholds, and creates a new image with these updated values. This is useful for tasks like image quantization, where the complexity of the image is reduced for easier analysis or compression. It can also be applied in preprocessing for machine learning, thresholding for object detection, or creating stylized artistic effects. The program simplifies images, making them more interpretable or suitable for specific applications, such as scientific imaging or data visualization.
